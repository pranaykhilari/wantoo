        <p>When you register for a Paid Subscription, Trial, or Code online, you consent to get access to a Wantoo Subscription immediately. If you reside outside of Canada and register for a Paid Subscription online, you may change your mind for any or no reason and receive a full refund for the previous month.</p>
        <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased as a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Wantoo will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service if available.</p>
        <p>If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through an authorized reseller, your subscription is also subject to the terms of your agreement with that authorized reseller (in addition to these Terms). To cancel your subscription, you must cancel directly with that authorized reseller.</p>
        <p>Wantoo may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid for), or Codes from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Wantoo Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Wantoo Service prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.</p>
        <br/>

Accordingly, if you choose to access our Site you agree to do so subject to the internal laws of British Columbia. The provincial court of British Columbia shall serve as the venue for any actions brought, or claims made, arising out of your use of this Site.</p>

		<p>Any failure by Wantoo.io to exercise its rights under these Terms of Use or to enforce the terms hereof shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. If any term of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court in any event should try to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and that all of the other provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
		<p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or relating to the terms of these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
